# RP6502 Project Template

Scaffolding for a new Picocomputer 6502 software project, in C with
either 6502 compiler, cc65 or llvm-mos, or in BASIC. The CMake preset
sets the language: the `cc65` and `llvm-mos` presets build the C program,
and the `basic` preset builds the BASIC program. Each program is "Hello,
world!".

`src/main.c` is the C program, which builds with either compiler:

```c
#include <rp6502.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "xram.h"

int main(void)
{
    puts("Hello, world!");
}
```

`src/main-cc65.s` and `src/main-llvm-mos.s` are assembly for that C.
To start an assembly language project, replace `src/main.c` in
`CMakeLists.txt` with the version for the assembler you will use.

`src/main.bas` is the BASIC program. `rp6502_basic()` packages it with
a BASIC ROM into `hello.rp6502`, and BASIC runs it at start:

```basic
10 PRINT "Hello, world!"
```

<!-- rp6502
preset: basic
publish: hello.zip
-->

On each push to `main`, `.github/workflows/web.yml` publishes this web
player and its screenshot to GitHub Pages. The `preset` in the `rp6502`
comment above the picture sets the program it plays: `basic` for the
BASIC program, or a `cc65/Release` or `llvm-mos/Release` preset for the
C program. To publish yours, open Settings > Pages on GitHub and set
Source to GitHub Actions.

The `if()` in `CMakeLists.txt` has a branch for each language. Keep the
branch you want, delete the other and the `if()`, and delete the presets
and files you do not use. Set the `preset` in the `rp6502` comment to a
preset you keep.

### Requirements:
 * CMake 3.21 or newer
 * Python 3
 * Make or Ninja
 * [cc65 or llvm-mos](https://github.com/picocomputer?view_as=public), for
   C. Install both if you want to try both.

The install steps for Windows, macOS and Linux are in
[RP6502-SDK](https://picocomputer.github.io/sdk.html#sdk-install), along with
the rest of the SDK documentation.

### Use the template:
Go to the [GitHub template](https://github.com/picocomputer/rp6502-sdk) and
select "Use this template" then "Create a new repository". Don't fork it: a
fork stays linked to this repository and includes its history, while "Use this
template" makes a new repository with a clean history. Then clone the new
repository.

### Updating the tools:
`tools/` holds the CMake and Python scripts that the SDK runs. Update them with
the "RP6502: update tools" task (Terminal > Run Task), or with:

```bash
$ cmake -P tools/rp6502.cmake
```

### Updating an older project:
Projects made before this template merged cc65 and llvm-mos have their compiler
wired into the top of `CMakeLists.txt`, and a `tools/` that predates any of
this. Start by copying this template's `tools/rp6502.cmake` over yours. That
name used to be the cc65 toolchain file; it is now the small script that
fetches everything, and the toolchain it replaces comes back as
`tools/cc65-toolchain.cmake` on the first configure.

Then replace everything above `project()` with:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)

include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/tools/rp6502.cmake)
```

Delete `tools/CMakeLists.txt` and the `add_subdirectory(tools)` line that
pulled it in — the `include()` above replaces both. Copy `CMakePresets.json`
from this template as well; that is where the compiler is chosen now. Old
projects called `rp6502_executable()` with the address their compiler happened
to use, and `DATA default RESET default` works under both.
